# Chordy
## Musical Theory library

## Features

- **utf8_symbols** (enabled by default): Uses proper UTF-8 musical symbols (♭, ♯, etc.) 
  in string representations. Disable this feature with `default-features = false` if you
  need ASCII-only output (for compatibility with terminals or systems that don't support
  these characters).
